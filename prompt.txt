**Ram:** So, have you finalized the dates for our trip to the coast? We need to book the flights soon.
**Raj:** Not yet. I was just looking at them. I was thinking maybe the first week of August. It seems like a good time and the weather should be perfect.
**Ram:** August sounds fun. Is that a long weekend or a full week? I'll need to put in a leave request.
**Raj:** It would be a full week, from Monday the 5th to Sunday the 11th. That gives us seven days to really relax and explore.
**Ram:** Perfect. And what about accommodations? Did you have anything in mind? Maybe a small rental house near the beach?
**Raj:** I found a great little cottage. It's only a five-minute walk from the sand and has a patio with an ocean view. It's a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it for the location.
**Ram:** That sounds amazing! Let's go for it. Send me the link and I'll book it tonight. I'm already getting excited.
**Raj:** Great. I'll send it over now. I can't wait either.

Ram arrived and shared that traffic wasn't an issue.
Ram brought the design thinking book I was interested in.
The book contains practical case studies relevant to my project.
I updated Ram on my project's steady progress and framework setup.
My goal is to finish the prototype in a month, with a buffer.
I thanked Ram for the book and plan to read it this weekend.
We decided to go for coffee.

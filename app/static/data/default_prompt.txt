Summarize the following transcript into crisp bullet points from the USERâ€™s perspective i.e. these notes should be something that the user reads and understands what happened in the conversation. 
- Make it abstractive (not just shortened lines).  
- Keep it short.
- One short sentence per point.
- Cover all key context without missing anything.  
- Do not include any extra text or explanation beyond the bullet points.
- Dont add any symbol for the point. Each new point should just be in a new line
